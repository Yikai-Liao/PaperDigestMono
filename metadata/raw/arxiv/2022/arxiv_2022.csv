2211.14077,Detecting broken Absorber Tubes in CSP plants using intelligent sampling and dual loss,"Concentrated solar power (CSP) is one of the growing technologies that is leading the process of changing from fossil fuels to renewable energies. The sophistication and size of the systems require an increase in maintenance tasks to ensure reliability, availability, maintainability and safety. Currently, automatic fault detection in CSP plants using Parabolic Trough Collector systems evidences two main drawbacks: 1) the devices in use needs to be manually placed near the receiver tube, 2) the Machine Learning-based solutions are not tested in real plants. We address both gaps by combining the data extracted with the use of an Unmaned Aerial Vehicle, and the data provided by sensors placed within 7 real plants. The resulting dataset is the first one of this type and can help to standardize research activities for the problem of fault detection in this type of plants. Our work proposes supervised machine-learning algorithms for detecting broken envelopes of the absorber tubes in CSP plants. The proposed solution takes the class imbalance problem into account, boosting the accuracy of the algorithms for the minority class without harming the overall performance of the models. For a Deep Residual Network, we solve an imbalance and a balance problem at the same time, which increases by 5% the Recall of the minority class with no harm to the F1-score. Additionally, the Random Under Sampling technique boost the performance of traditional Machine Learning models, being the Histogram Gradient Boost Classifier the algorithm with the highest increase (3%) in the F1-Score. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first providing an automated solution to this problem using data from operating plants.",cs.LG|cs.AI,cs.LG,Miguel Angel PÃ©rez-CutiÃ±o|Juan SebastiÃ¡n Valverde|JosÃ© Miguel DÃ­az-BÃ¡Ã±ez,2022-11-25,2024-12-02,10.1007/s10489-023-05093-3,,
